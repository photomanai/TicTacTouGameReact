# Tic Tac Toe Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React** and **Vite**. The project is designed to be a fun way to demonstrate React concepts and state management. It supports two players who take turns to place their markers (X and O) on the board until one wins or the game ends in a draw.
